\section{Introduction}
In this document, we describe the necessary steps to reproduce the pipeline presented
in the paper ``A flexible workflow for simulating transcranial electric stimulation in healthy 
and lesioned brains".
The purpose of this software pipeline is the simulation of transcranial electric current stimulation
based on computational models derived from individual MR-images. The workflow covers all essential
steps from head model creation from MR data, electrode modeling, and positioning, simulation
as well as visualization.\\
The segmentation workflow and the post-processing of the segmentation has been published and
described in detail before \cite{kalloch2018semi}.\\
For a detailed description of the remaining processing steps along with additional
background information please refer to the corresponding paper.
