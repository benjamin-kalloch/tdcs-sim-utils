This test case is for reference only. It cannot be run.
You can check the setFieldsDict, the field information
in 0_orig as well the solverproperties files to see which
adaptations were necessary to simulate a multi-electrode
test case with anisotropic conductivity.
As an example for a standard, isotropic, two-electrode
test case refer to the almi5_DUAL test case stub.
