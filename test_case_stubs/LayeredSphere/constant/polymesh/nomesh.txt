No geometry here. Please generate the geometry in GMSH fist using our Geo-file and the import it with the "gmshToFoam" utility.
Due to storage restrictions we only provide the faceSets representing the electrodes.
Note that these sets will only correspond to the correct triangle if you use an edge-length of 0.00629961
for the sphere geometry in the geo-file.
